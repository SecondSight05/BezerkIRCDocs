This file is accessed at the end of the game, during the "New Episodes every..." screen.<br>Like jolinfo0.cgi, a response is not required.

Note: I'm not sure if there are any other values you're supposed to respond with, however this works fine.

Needed values (In this order):<br>`Error` - Unknown use. Just set it to "100".

Example response:<br>`Error=100`
