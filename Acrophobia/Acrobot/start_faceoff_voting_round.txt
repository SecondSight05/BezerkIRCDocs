Used to start a voting round for everyone besides the two faceoff players. (I could be wrong about this)

1st Detail - Unknown.
2nd Detail - Unknown.
3rd Detail - Round music. (See "start_faceoff_comp_round" for details)
4th Detail - The acronym. (Must be in all caps)

(This command doesn't fully work currently. It "freezes" the game and you can't send any other commands. It's probably missing some details.)
