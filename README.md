# Bezerk Documentation
This is documentation of all the network requests and responses for the Bezerk games.

So, if you want to make your own Bezerk Revived, here you go... enjoy!

(If you just want to play the games, check out [Bezerk Revived](https://bezerk.secondzone.co.uk/).)

(Also, please note that not everything has been figured out yet.)
