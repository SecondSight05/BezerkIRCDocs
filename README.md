# Bezerk IRC Documentation
This is documentation of the commands used by the IRC bots in three of the Bezerk games from the late 90's.
These are sent in the chat of a specific channel. (For example, the ListNick bot in Acrophobia uses the #Acro_List channel.)

(Originally for the Bezerk Revived project.)

Note: Not all of the commands have been figured out yet.
